## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **File Not Found**: Ensure `remote-trainee-jobs.txt` is in the same directory as the scripts.

3. **Memory Issues**: For large datasets, consider processing in chunks or using a more powerful machine.

4. **Visualization Issues**: If charts don't display, try running in a Jupyter notebook or check your matplotlib backend.

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the console output for error messages
2. Verify your Python version (3.7+ recommended)
3. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed
4. Check that the input file format matches the expected structure
